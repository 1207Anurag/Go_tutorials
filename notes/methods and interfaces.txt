interface-->set of related object and types
like a rectangle and circle both have area...both are shapes

it lets us define some kinds of behaviour that is similar between 
objects or types


"example--> if it quacks, moves and swims like a duuck then it should be a duck"
we are conceren with only the behaviour not the actual thing

or a socket..dosent know whome it is giving power the only work it do is to give power to
powerDrawerInterface{
    Draw(power int)
}
interfact is an abstract type it only describe the expexted behaviour

type printer interface(){
	//behaviour is of print
	print()  //just a method name without code
}
