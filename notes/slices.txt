//Go Slices: usage and internals
/Go codes often don't make use of array coz of it's inflexibility

we can create a slice with a built in function called make
//relation between len and capacity
-> len and cap both will return 0 for nil slice

//Internals of slicing

-Slice if a descriptor of an array segment, 
-it consist of pointer to the array, len of the segment and capacity
-capacity is number of element underlying array
- slice does not copy the slice's data, it create new slices that points to the original array
-slices (Never grows) instead it creates a new slices instead and copy the data into the new one"!!!!!
//this is the dynamic array implementation (Growing Slices)
